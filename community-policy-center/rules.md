This document outlines the rules for participating in the CyberPatriot Discord.

{% hint style="danger" %}
#### The scope of this document

This list is meant to offer guidance to members for what is and is not considered appropriate conduct in the community, as well as create an enforcement framework for moderators.

**However, these rules do not limit moderators' authority to enforcement.** Conduct in the community need not violate any specific point in this document to still be moderated. Moderators retain the ultimate authority on this, and have the final say on moderation matters.

We furthermore reserve the right to make changes to this list at any time without prior notice and/or further explanation. Rule changes are announced in the server.

_**By joining the community and participating in it, you affirm that you have read, understood, and accept these rules as they are written. You furthermore affirm your commitment to making a reasonable effort to follow them at all times.**_

## 1. No harassment or personal attacks.

Be respectful towards others. Do not attempt to create drama.

## 2. No NSFW content.

This applies to everything, including (but not limited to) images and text. If it's even suggestive, it's not allowed.

## 3. No advertising.

This applies to advertisements of any kind, and includes direct messages.

## 4. No spamming.

Many things constitute spam, including (but not limited to): excessive amounts of messages, images, emotes, or reactions, mass-pinging users or roles, annoying or unreadable nicknames or text, creating excessive threads or forums, and bandwagoning (chains of messages, emotes, or actions done by one or more users in excessive amounts).

## 5. Use proper channels.

Each channel has a purpose; please make sure to stay on topic. The ⁠windows/⁠linux/⁠cisco channels are only for serious windows/linux/cisco discussion (respectively) and ⁠comp\_results is for CyberScores commands and _light_, related discussion. Threads follow the same rules as its parent channel.

## 6. Follow CyberPatriot rules.

Do not share CyberPatriot scripts, checklists, answers, readmes, or any other prohibited competition materials. See [https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/competition/rules-book](https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/competition/rules-book). Do not share personal or identifying information, even if they are made up. We do not allow discussion around topics that can be characterised as illegal, harmful, immoral, unethical, or otherwise objectionable for any reason.&#x20;

## 7. Respect Discord's Community Guidelines and Terms of Service.

We abide by Discord's Community Guidelines and Terms of Service, and require members to do the same. See [https://discord.com/guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and [https://discord.com/terms](https://discord.com/terms). Should your Discord client be modified (in contravention to Discord's Terms of Service), you may not send any media (images, videos, etc.) of your client until these modifications are removed or otherwise not visible.

## 8. Do not accuse any teams or states of cheating.

Do not joke about this topic. If you have credible proof of another team cheating, you may contact CyberPatriot with your concerns or DM @Modmail.

## 9. Make a reasonable effort to find answers to your question yourself before asking.

This community has plenty of people that are glad to offer support. This, however, does not mean that the server should be utilized instead of resources like Google or StackOverflow, but rather as a complement to them. Furthermore, please keep all questions within the server, do not Direct Message members with them. We also ask that you wait a minimum of 15 minutes after asking a question to ping a helper role.

## 10. Keep chat in English.

We use English as our primary language for communication. Additionally, nicknames must be easily mentionable and may not contain any characters that aim to reduce legibility or mentionability.

## 11. Don't try to find loopholes in the rules.

If you even have to ask if something is against the rules, it probably is. Stretching the rules is breaking the rules. Additionally, if a moderator says to cease a particular action, continuing to do it, even at a later time, is breaking the rules.
