## How to read this documentation

### Rules

The content and spirit of any rule will be defined in brief under the section for that rule. Sections may additionally contain collapsible parts that provide further detail. However, the full rule or FAQ entry consists of both the immediately visible _and_ collapsible sections of it - **ignoring collapsible sections will often result in missing important details on edge cases, enforcement, and more**. Claiming that one broke the rules due to not having read the collapsible sections is not a valid excuse.
